mod_log_sqlite - Apache logging module to sqlite

INSTALL:

You can install this module easily via apxs magic.

  % make
  # make install
  % make clean

CONFIGURATION (sample):

First you should install sqlite module manually. See
http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/ for details.

Then you should initialize access_log database. Note that the database
file and the directory can be writable by httpd running user (nobody
by default).

  # mkdir /usr/local/apache/sqlite-logs
  # chown nobody:nobody /usr/local/apache/sqlite-logs
  % sudo -u nobody sqlite /usr/local/apache/sqlite-logs/sqlite_log < create_table.sql

"create_table.sql" is bundled with this module.

Finally, simply add the following line to your httpd.conf:

  LogSQLiteDBFile sqlite-logs/sqlite_log

Table name is "access_log" by default. You can change it via
"LogSQLiteTable" directive if you want to.

  LogSQLiteTable wwwlog


That's all! Enjoy querying your access_log via VIEWs and/or sub-querys.
